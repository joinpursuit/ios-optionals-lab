## Question 1

a. Given the variable `userNameOne` below, print *"The username is Test User"*.  Use *Optional Binding* (`if let`) to print the name.

```swift
var userNameOne: String? = "Test User"
```
Answer
```swift
var userNameOne: String? = "Test User"

if let name = userNameOne {
    print("The username is \(name)")
}
```

b. Given the variable `userNameTwo` below, print *"The username is undefined"*.  Use the *nil coalescing operator* (`??`).

```swift
var userNameTwo: String? = nil
```
Answer
```swift
var userNameTwo: String? = nil

let name = userNameTwo ?? "The username is undefined"

print(name)
```
## Question 2

a. Given the variables `rectOneWidth` and `rectOneHeight` below, print "The area of rectOne is 50".  Use *Optional Binding* (`if let`) to print the area.

```swift
var rectOneWidth: Double? = 5
var rectOneHeight: Double? = 10
```
Answer
```swift
var rectOneWidth: Double? = 5
var rectOneHeight: Double? = 10

if let width = rectOneWidth, let height = rectOneHeight {
    print("The area of rectOne is \(Int(width) * Int(height))")
}
```

b. Given the variables `rectTwoWidth` and `rectTwoHeight` below, print "The are of rectTwo is not able to be calculated".  Use *Optional Binding* (`if let`) to print this message.

```swift
var rectTwoWidth: Double? = nil
var rectTwoHeight: Double? = nil
```
Answer
```swift
var rectTwoWidth: Double? = nil
var rectTwoHeight: Double? = nil

if let width = rectTwoWidth, let height = rectTwoHeight {
    print("The area of rectTwo is \(Int(width) * Int(height))")
} else {
    print("The are of rectTwo is not able to be calculated")
}
```
## Question 3

a. Given the variables `userOneName`, `userOneAge`, and `userOneHeight` below, write code that prints "Hello Anne!  You are 15 years old and 5.8 feet tall" (1 foot = 12 inches).  Use optional binding.


```swift
var userOneName: String? = "Anne"
var userOneAge: Int? = 15
var userOneHeight: Double? = 70
```
Answer
```swift
var userOneName: String? = "Anne"
var userOneAge: Int? = 15
var userOneHeight: Double? = 70

if let userName = userOneName, let userAge = userOneAge, let userHeight = userOneHeight {
    print("Hello \(userName)!  You are \(userAge) years old and \(String(format: "%.1f", userHeight / 12)) feet tall")
}
```
b. Given the variables `userTwoName`, `userTwoAge` and `userTwoHeight` below, write code that prints "Hello user!  You are 15 years old and I don't know how tall you are".  Use optional binding

```swift
var userTwoName: String? = nil
var userTwoAge: Int? = 15
var userTwoHeight: Double? = nil
```
Answer
```swift
var userTwoName: String? = nil
var userTwoAge: Int? = 15
var userTwoHeight: Double? = nil

if let userName = userTwoName, let userAge = userTwoAge, let userHeight = userTwoHeight {
    print("Hello \(userName)!  You are \(userAge) years old and \(String(format: "%.1f", userHeight / 12)) feet tall")
} else if let userHeight = userTwoHeight, let userAge = userTwoAge {
    print("Hello user!  You are \(userAge) years old and \(String(format: "%.1f", userHeight / 12)) feet tall")
} else if let userAge = userTwoAge {
    print("Hello user! You are \(userAge) years old and I don't know how tall you are")
} 
```

## Question 4

Give the variable `favoriteNumber`, write code that either prints "Your favorite number is " followed by the number, or "I don't know what your favorite number is"

`favoriteNumber` is of type Int? and will either be `nil` or a random number between 0 and 10.  It will change each time you run your Playground.

```swift
var favoriteNumber = Bool.random() ? Int.random(in: 0...10) : nil
```



## Question 5

Given the variables `numOne`, `numTwo` and `numThree`, write code that prints "The sum of all the numbers is " followed by their sum.  If a number is `nil`, don't add it to the sum.  If all numbers are `nil`, the sum is zero.

```swift
var numOne = Bool.random() ? Int.random(in: 0...10) : nil
var numTwo = Bool.random() ? Int.random(in: 0...10) : nil
var numThree = Bool.random() ? Int.random(in: 0...10) : nil
```
Answer
```swift
var numOne = Bool.random() ? Int.random(in: 0...10) : nil
var numTwo = Bool.random() ? Int.random(in: 0...10) : nil
var numThree = Bool.random() ? Int.random(in: 0...10) : nil
let sum = (numOne ?? 0) + (numTwo ?? 0) + (numThree ?? 0)

print(sum)
```
## Question 6

a. Given the variable `numbers` below, write code that prints "The sum of all the numbers is " followed by their sum.  If a number is `nil`, don't add it to the sum.  If all numbers are `nil`, the sum is zero.

```swift
var numbers = [Int?]()

for _ in 0..<10 {
    numbers.append(Bool.random() ? Int.random(in: 0...100) : nil)
}
```
Answer
```swift
var numbers = [Int?]()
var sum = 0

for num in 0..<10 {
    numbers.append(Bool.random() ? Int.random(in: 0...100) : nil)
    sum += numbers[num] ?? 0
}

print("The sum of all the numbers is \(sum)")
```
b. Using the same variable, find the average of all non-nil values.

Answer
```swift
var numbers = [Int?]()
var sum = 0
var count = 0

for _ in 0..<10 {
    numbers.append(Bool.random() ? Int.random(in: 0...100) : nil)
}

for num in numbers where num != nil {
    sum += num ?? 0
    count += 1
}


print("The sum of all the numbers is \(sum / count)")
```
